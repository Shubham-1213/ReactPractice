        Medical disposables are single-use products designed for short-term or
        one-time use in healthcare settings. These items include gloves,
        syringes, surgical masks, gowns, drapes, catheters, and sterile
        dressings. They play a crucial role in maintaining hygiene, preventing
        cross-contamination, and ensuring patient safety. By using disposables,
        healthcare providers can minimize the risk of infections and improve
        overall patient care quality. The demand for medical disposables has
        increased significantly, especially in light of global health challenges
        such as pandemics, highlighting their importance in modern medical
        practice.
